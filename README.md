# Getting Started

This project is a full-stack web application built with Next.js and Jotai. It features an advanced search functionality, user authentication, and personalized features such as saving favorite search results and viewing search history. The application's server-side functionality is handled by a server.js file, deployed on Vercel, and the front-end is built with Bootstrap for a responsive interface.
