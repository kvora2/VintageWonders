# Welcome to exploration of Vintage Wonders 🏛️

This project is a full-stack web application built with Next.js and Jotai. It features an advanced search functionality, user authentication, and personalized features such as saving favorite search results and viewing search history. The application's server-side functionality is handled by a server.js file, deployed on Vercel, and the front-end is built with Bootstrap for a responsive interface.

## Visit here for demonstration

You can access a live demo of the application here -> [VintageWondersAPI](https://vintagewonders.vercel.app).

## Backend API

For handling user data storage and authentication, I have developed a custom API using Express.js and MongoDB. This API provides endpoints for user registration, login, saving favorites, and managing search history.

The backend API is deployed separately and is being accessed from here -> [backend-api-url](https://your-backend-api.com).
